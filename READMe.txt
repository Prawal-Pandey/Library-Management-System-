<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the report of the project work designed to produce a system or an application that handles library management systems. The program was developed with the precise aid of algorithms and pseudocodes accompanied by the flowcharts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the tasks assigned were not so easy. In order to describe our ability to understand and face the questions as well as demonstrate them in an illustrative way as per the requirement requires a lot of firmness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This project work i.e. library management system is similar to the inventory system which will help the user to borrow and return the books available in the library. The library is a place where the user can borrow and return the book with his/her desire. The library lets its users choose any of the available books to borrow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, you may ask why we need to develop this system when there is no need for it. Because the libraries of today are coping well with their old methods i.e. recording the user borrowed or returned history in the paper rather than in software. Even without the help of today’s modern software the libraries are managing and are not facing any problems. Yes, it is true but we should always see for the future progress. Because there are technological advances in every sector in today’s world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the new technologies and systems being brought up to life the old methods or techniques should start to change with the passage of time. There is a need for developing this system because our libraries are slowly changing into modern ones and they need the newly developed software.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This software or program will help the libraries to keep the proper track of the books borrowed and returned by the user and will help them to ensure there is no loss of books.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This system is user friendly and time-efficient and can help to avoid the unnecessary duplication of the data and makes it easier to understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main feature of this project is that it will enable the user to understand the IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) in python and help them to use the system to the fullest. It will help even those people who don’t understand a little about the programming language to use this program to its fullest and without any errors. This program will let the programmer to work with different functions and statements and helps to understand the programming language more in depth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. Discussion and Analysis:</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the discussion portion of this task, a lot of research was done in order to solve the problem and also had a brief description about python in different websites and books. The websites from which I have taken help are given in the Bibliography section with the full detail of it. After hard work and regular contact with the module leaders and friends I was able to do this project work. There are some important things without which this task would not be possible to do.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. Data Structures</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To carry out different operations in Python for input/output and for data storage this project makes the maximum utilization of the collection data type list. Python also provides varieties of data types like integer, string, Boolean, float etc. Some of the data types and data structures were used while writing the program to store and manipulate the data and perform various operations on them. The data types and structures used in the program are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Integer<br></li><li>Float<br></li><li>String<br></li><li>Boolean<br></li><li>List</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Integer data type was used in the program to store all the numerical values provided by the users as well as the results developed from the different operations. For instance, it is used to store the quantity of the books in the variable quantity[index].</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, float data type is used to store decimal values in the program. It is used to store the total cost price of the books in the variable total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Correspondingly, string data type is used to store textual data having sequences of one or more characters. Various operations like choice, stat are carried out in string. Most of the printed statements in our .py file are often concatenated and of data type string.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The different functions of our .py file string data type are used for storing the decision of the user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Likewise, Boolean is used to store one character (either true or false). It is used in the program to check conditions and stored in variables like loop, success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, the list is used to store values on book name, author name, quantity and cost in our .py file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the list is mutable collection data types, the value on the list can be added or removed as per the user needs by the use of methods append() and extend() which have been successful to include in different modules of our .py folder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Testing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Testing is an important portion that is to be carried out while developing any program as it helps to find the error if there is any error and helps to debug the program. Testing helps us to get familiar with the type of error and handle the errors with the necessary formatting in the program.</p>

The steady effort and boundless research related to different themes made the tasks less difficult to carry out. After various research and practise we were able to know how exactly the program runs and what are the correct codes for the program. Lots of websites, journals and books were consulted for gaining information on various important topics. The research not only enhanced our knowledge to complete the project work, it also sharpened our knowledge and understanding about various topics in python.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This project work was finally completed with lots of hardship, several research on the related topics such as flowcharts, algorithm, pseudocode and so on. The tasks assigned in the project work were not easy at all. The code was written and tested to confirm that it had no bugs and errors and delivered the accurate result. For the successful completion of all the tasks, each task was carried out in steps, which made the task easier.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This project work helped the way to do a task in a certain time period in a managed way and also helped to develop skills which will be very helpful in the future as well. While doing the project I gained sound knowledge of python, its data structures, its various in-built functions, comments, while and for loops, if/else conditionals and many more. This project helped to gain valuable experience. All in all, although the tasks were tough and required nights of hard work and labor, successfully completing those tough tasks was a lot of fun.</p>
